# NYC_Citibike

Purpose
The goal of this analysis is to utilize bike sharing data from Citi Bike in New York City to see if it could be used in De Moiunes, Iowa.

Results
Some things that I did to complete this analysis include:
-Cleaned the data using Pandas library in Python
-Created visualizations through Tableau

The top starting locations and the top ending locations are displayed below.

You can see that the top producing parts of NYC include the most populated areas within New York City, such as Manhattan.

When looking at the trips by gender and weekday, you can see the patterns among the day of the week and the gender of the user. I found this data interesting to compare.

Summary
As shown above, men use the ride sharing app more, so they should be the targeted audience when promoting a bike sharing app. When you see that more bikes are used in more populated areas, it makes sense to ensure there are more bikes available in that area to ensure the numbers will continue to increase.

When using bike sharing data, you have to look at these various traits to try to help a similar bike sharing program wihtin another city or state.
